# .well-known
A simple method to let Discord connects to your GitHub Pages domain in profile connections and recognise your ownership to it, also showing on your profile.
Fork this repo and let the name _intact_, replace the content in ```.discord``` file to your own content and enable GitHub Pages in repo settings as below:

You can find your verification (.discord) content here when connecting domain in Discord:

Thanks [oyepriyansh] for this trick. Visit their repo [here](https://github.com/oyepriyansh/.well-known).

Perhaps it also works for custom domain linking in GitHub Pages I guess. 
DNS method (_may_) sounds unable to do, but I have not tested.

P/S: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) custom handle works too.  Just put the verification file with content into a specified file in user settings.
